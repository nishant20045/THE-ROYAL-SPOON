 THE ROYAL SPOON
 "THE ROYAL SPOON - A Delightful Dining Experience Online!"
 *"Recently, I designed and developed a restaurant website, The Royal Spoon, featuring an intuitive and 
engaging user experience. The website includes a dynamic menu with categorized sections for starters, main 
courses, and beverages, all styled with an Indian restaurant theme. The homepage greets users with a warm 
and human-like welcome message, while dedicated pages for 'About Us' and 'Menu' open in separate tabs.
 One of the key features is a visually appealing Add to Cart system, where users can seamlessly adjust item 
quantities and remove selections. The order process is streamlined with an interactive address input and an 
estimated delivery time feature, enhancing the customer experience.
 This project showcases my skills in front-end development, and user-friendly interface creation."*# THE-ROYAL-SPOON
